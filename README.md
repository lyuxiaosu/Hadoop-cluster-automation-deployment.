# Hadoop-cluster-automation-deployment.
This project includes a group of scripts which can deploy a hadoop cluster on docker containers automatically, including how to use docker to create a container, how to use weave to connect two physical machines, how to specify the number of cpu cores, cpu frequency, memory, and disk io speed for a container, etc.  Also, it can run different mapreduce applications on clusters and collect useful information from hadoop logs automatically. Finally, these useful data will be fed to a tensorflow DNN model to learn and give a prediction for a task's execution time
